## 💡 What is Neuma?
Derived from the Greek word "pneuma" meaning breath or spirit, Neuma Base Flutter is designed to bring life into your Flutter projects without getting in your way 🤩

It’s a lightweight yet scalable Flutter starter with a feature-first architecture and a DDD-inspired folder structure — perfect for rapid prototyping, real-world app development, and clean production-ready codebases.
